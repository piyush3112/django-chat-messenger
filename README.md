## Implementation
 - python3 & django for back-end restful api and auth system
 - jquery & ajax for front-end calls
 - html5, css3 & bootstrap3 for setting content and designing responsive style
 - postgres for db (switched through sqlite3 to mysql to postgres)
 
 ## Further improvements
 - Using a front-end framework to call back-end api (e.g Angular2 or React.js)
 - For project expansion, using nosql database (e.g Mongodb)
 - Trying to use django 'Sockets' and 'Channels' for a real-time massenger
 - Handle some ux/ui enhancements
